"Clean Code" is the name of a book that talks about how you should write your code to make it clean, to make it easy to understand, to be easily changed.

The user [ryanmcdermott](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott) on Github created a repository that shows several examples of clean code with JavaScript.

You can see the [clean-code-javascript repository here](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).
