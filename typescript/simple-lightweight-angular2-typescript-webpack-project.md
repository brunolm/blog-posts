I wanted to create a project using Angular2. I started to code it and I realized I would have to setup a few things.

I choose to use Webpack because it has some dev tools, auto-reload. It wasn’t so simple to set it up, their documentation didn’t help me much.

It was then that I decided I needed to make things simpler so I created <a href="https://github.com/brunolm/angular2-startup">brunolm/angular2-startup</a>. It is a project with just the essential, nothing else. Simple and clean.

You can see that in this project there is a `README.md` where I tried to write all the steps I went through to create that setup and the issues I faced.

I recently started using Workflowy (it is free), which is a website where you can create lists and it allows you to use as a brain dump. If you want to check it out you can use this link to get extra items <a href="https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx">https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx</a>

And I also added <a href="https://workflowy.com/s/HO3ACHwWFT">all the steps on my Workflowy</a> and instructions on <a href="https://workflowy.com/s/5Ppxs0k72u">my Knowledge List</a>.
