[github.com/brunolm/react-how-to](https://github.com/brunolm/react-how-to) is a repository that shows how to do things by example.

Each Pull Request on this repository is a complete guide on how to do something, for example if you want to add `redux` to your project you can just check [this Pull Request](https://github.com/brunolm/react-how-to/pull/10) and see some instructions and all changes required.

If you want to setup [tests check this Pull Request](https://github.com/brunolm/react-how-to/pull/1).

Better than just reading some instructions you get a full example and a working project as a guide.

Enjoy!
