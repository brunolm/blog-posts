I checked a diff between a project created with Angular 4 and 5 CLI. There were no changes on the generated project structure.

So to upgrade you just need to install new versions of packages.

You can see which [packages to update in this pull request](https://github.com/brunolm/angular-how-to/pull/6/files).
